    "description": "Stay connected to Islam with Taslim, a Google Chrome extension that provides accurate Salah times based on your location. As Allah (SWT) says in the Qur'an: 'Indeed, performing prayers is a duty on the believers at the appointed times.' (Qur'an, 4:103). Taslim helps you uphold this command by sending timely reminders for Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha, as well as Tahajjud and Duha prayers. Tahajjud, the night prayer, is a special time to seek Allah's mercy and forgiveness, while Duha is a prayer of gratitude for the blessings of the day. With customisable settings to adjust time formats and calculation methods, you can ensure the extension meets your needs, wherever you are in the world. Stay mindful and punctual with your Salah, and let Taslim guide you through each prayer time with ease, bringing you closer to the Creator.",
